      <h3>Mindfulness conversation</h3>
      <h4>9 April 2016</h4>
      
      <p>
        Today I had a msot relaxing conversation. Simply by taking turns to give another person our full attention. I was pleasantly surprised by how much can be learnt by listening without agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other person found it beneficial even contemplating "why don't we do this more often?". Taking a moment to listen and understand another person is a rare but powerful thing. That's what I learnt from the mindfulness conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
        As these cultural posts are responses to the <em>Search Inside Yourself</em> book, I'll briefly talk about a technique which I learnt in the 3rd chapter. <b>Do less meditation than you can</b>. Huh? Why would I do only do 5 minutes today if I feel like I could stretch that 10 minutes? Surely I should 'train my brain' for longer if I think I can. Turns out this is because of consistency. The author argues that it is essential to enjoy a short session everyday and to build this habit. Extending a session where I start to get restless will make the next session a little less attractive and making the practice of meditiation habitual will serve me well on those days when I need it most.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't know what to think about the 'witty' comics that inject a bit of dry humour into the pages of the book. I hope there's some reason for the talking brains and meditating babies. Ah well, some of them are a good laugh.
