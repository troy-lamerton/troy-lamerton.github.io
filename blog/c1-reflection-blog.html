      Wow. Just finished skimming through a founder of DBC answering questions about the curriculum of Dev Bootcamp. It gives me a bit more insight into what's in store for me throughout this journey at Dev Academy in Wellington.
    </p>
    <p>
      The EDA experience is meant to be an engaging and active 18 weeks, where I have a lot to learn and also the opportunity to teach my peers.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm starting to realise I've signed up for something a bit more full on than what I was expecting. What I knew about the course one week ago was the tip of the iceberg. That excites me albeit a nervous excitement.

    <p>
      I was in two minds about how software development is best practiced - focused and individual or collaborative and exploratory.
      <br>
      EDA intends to mostly teach the latter, which I've always thought is a lot more enjoyable, but questioned whether it was the most efficient. Now I'm tending towards this approach being both the most fun and most efficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      For myself, immersing myself in this learner/teacher culture will be a challenge. To get the most out of this experience I will be doing my best to adapt to the EDA environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      All challenges and excitement intertwined, I look forward to discovering the rest of the iceberg.
