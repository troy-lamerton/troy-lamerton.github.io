      <h3>Grasping and aversion</h3>
      <h4>25 April 2016</h4>
      
      <p>
        This chapter "Riding your emotions like a horse", extended from last week's chapter about being aware of one's emotions. It gave me mental tools to deal with triggers as well as explaining the theory behind suffering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Grasping and aversion are the cause of almost all suffering, the author explained. I learnt about how holding onto thoughts and emotions (grasping) leads to suffering. Intuitively this makes sense. If I am attached to a thought/idea/emotion, things that threaten to take away this thought will bring me stress and suffering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aversion is when we bury a thought and do not let it rise to our conscious awareness. Our minds are not computers, we cannot simply delete something and never remember it again. The book has convinced me that letting go is the best approach.
      </p>

        My two minutes of mindfulness today was relaxing. I always open my eyes with a clearer mind, ready to do what I need to minus all the distractions.
