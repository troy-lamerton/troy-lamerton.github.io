    <h2>A blog post the-day-after learning what timeboxing is, and spending an hour in the box.</h2>

    <!-- which timebox and habits techniques did you try,
          what did you find interesting?
          what worked for you?
          which will you experiment further with?

        Having read a fair amount about meditation and mindfulness, some articles felt famaliar. At the end of each article, I reminded myself to have a growth mindset, looking to learn from the article. It felt like being curious about what I had just read, instead of dismissing it 'already know that, next thing'.

        I found the Fogg Method particularly interesting. I reflected on how I could apply this habit forming method to something in my own life.
        <br>
        The notion that <em>behaviour leads to mindset</em> was an underlying theme between a few of the articles/videos. This contradicts the idea that believing 'I can do this' is needed before doing. Just do it, then you can look back and believe in yourself.

        A few techniques have held my attention absorbing the content yesterday.
        <br>
        I will be experimenting with:
        <ul>
          <li>the Pomodoro Technique (25 min task + 5 min break) - previously I've heard that, based on average attention span research, the optimal split for continued focus on a task is 21 min task + 3 min break.</li>
          <li>starting small, obtaining small successes and working towards something bigger.</li>
          <li>regular short meditation sessions, especially after exercise - I usually meditate for 10 minutes or not at all.</li>
        </ul>
        I may also go back and watch the TED talk, which I skipped to get a taste of all the other links.
