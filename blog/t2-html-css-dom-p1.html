        <h3>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h3>
        <p>
          Imagine a decorated fence.
          <ul>
            <li>HTML is the posts, pickets and slats. It is the structure of the fence.</li>
            <li>CSS is the paint on the wood and the decorations hanging off it. Different posts could be painted different colours, and photos can be on the fence.</li>
            <li>Take a photo of the fence. The photo is the DOM. The photo is not the fence, it is the camera's intepretation of the fence.</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>What is meant by boxifying design?</h3>
        <p>
          Boxifying design is a method of understanding a design mock to more easily create the webpage. The programmer  draws boxes around each thing on the design mock where each thing will respresent one element in the HTML code.

        <h3>What is the box model?</h3>
        <p>
          The box model is applicable to (probably) all HTML elements. The box model consists of 4 different components which can each be styled individually. Every element can have <code>margins</code> keeping it away from other elements, a <code>border</code>, <code>padding</code> between the border and the actual <code>content</code>.
