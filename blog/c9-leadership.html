        <b>My experience with leaders and leading.</b>
        <br>Inspiring and guiding people has always been a fascination of mine.

        The multiplying goodness meditation felt the most real for me out of all the meditiations that have had me visualise others. It was difficult to remember all the instructions for the whole meditation. Like with a few of Search Inside Yourself's exercises, it feels like I am doing a directed meditation with only just enough direction.

        Another meditation in this chapter was one that I feared would be a negative experience, and I put off doing it. But when I sat and visualised breathing in suffering, breathing out warmth and understanding, I was surprised. It was calming to imagine anxiousness and anger, just noticing the emotions and then breathing out with a sense of warmth. This Tonglen meditation has grown on me.

        How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?
        Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? (It's a valuable skill, but can take practice to develop!)
        Any other musings?
